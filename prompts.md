Our data pipeline through Dockling also uses OCR through Dockling itself.
apparently according to the docking documentation you can change your OCR engine let's use EasyOCR 
EasyOCR is built on top of PyTorch, which means it naturally supports GPU acceleration via CUDA (on NVIDIA hardware). When a CUDA-enabled GPU is available, EasyOCR will automatically leverage it to speed up inference. This makes it a popular choice if you need faster OCR performance in deep learningâ€“based pipelines.
