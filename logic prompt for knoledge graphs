We could ask O3 or R1 to perform the following task:

Read the new PDF files incl Graphs and tables
Understand the main new thematic topic and methods
Generate a short technical summary of main implementation
Identify KG nodes that are similar to new technical summary
Extract the reasoning traces from KG and compare to tech summary
Identify overlaps and contradictory triplets to new tech summary
Calculate probabilities for correct reasoning traces incl new research
Delete specific reasoning traces in KG and note all dependencies
Insert new knowledge triplets in my KG
Validate thematic coherence of new subgraphs in KG
...
plus MORE... too complicated...use individula agents


Ingestion Agents (IA): Retrieve raw documents (PDF/HTML), normalize text (handling OCR errors, tables), and extract metadata (authors, journal, publication date).

Reader Agents (RA): Split documents into sections, score segment relevance using KG context, and filter non-relevant content (e.g., acknowledgments).

Summarizer Agents (SA): Condense text segments into concise summaries while preserving entity relationships (e.g., "Drug X inhibits Protein Y, reducing Disease Z symptoms" â†’ "X inhibits Y; Y linked to Z").

Entity Extraction Agents (EEA): Identify entities via few-shot LLM prompts, then normalize them to KG canonical forms using ontology-guided embedding alignment.

Relationship Extraction Agents (REA): Detect relationships (e.g., treats, causes) between entity pairs using multi-label classification, allowing overlapping relations (e.g., "Drug A both inhibits Protein B and triggers Side Effect C").

Schema Alignment Agents (SAA): Map novel entities/relations to KG schema types (e.g., classifying "CRISPR-Cas9" as Gene-Editing Tool) or flag them for ontology expansion.

Conflict Resolution Agents (CRA): Resolve contradictions (e.g., new triplet "Drug D treats Disease E" vs. existing "Drug D exacerbates Disease E") via LLM debate and evidence aggregation.

Evaluator Agents (EA): Compute integration confidence using weighted signals (confidence, relevance, clarity) and apply threshold-based final approval.
